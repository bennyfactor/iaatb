# IAATB v 3.0 (or 4.0) (or 5?)
This contains the files to build the new iaatb.net site, which will finally be platform agnostic (no wordpress/mediawiki), and maybe even fully static, especially if I can figure out how to do comments / the photodump. Will use chaplin eventually for templating.

# Brunch app

This is HTML5 application, built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Getting started
* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * [Bower](http://bower.io): `npm install -g bower`
    * Brunch plugins and Bower dependencies: `npm install & bower install`.
    * Sass 3.3 and Compass (via ruby): `bundle install --local`.
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
    * [Brunch site](http://brunch.io), [Chaplin site](http://chaplinjs.org)
